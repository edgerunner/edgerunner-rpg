# Edgerunner Role Playing Game

{% hint style="info" %}
Edgerunner is now hosted on [Gitbook](http://gitbook.com), because the previous platform it was hosted on: [Radiant CMS](http://radiantcms.org) is no longer maintained, and began rotting away. It takes effort to stay on the edge. Welcome to 2020.

## Welcome to the Edge

This is a work in progress site about building a FATE system powered Cyberpunk role playing game. It is pretty much playable as it is now, with most of the rules and resources ready. Only a few sections and some examples are missing, but those are easily guessed if you have played any FATE game before.

_The game is going through a big overhaul right now, and many things are changing. Please bear with any inconsistencies and check the_ [_changelog_](edgerunner/changelog.md) _to keep up on what has changed._

Please ask your gameplay questions at [RPG Stackexchange](http://rpg.stackexchange.com/).

The reference FATE implementation is [Diaspora](http://www.vsca.ca/Diaspora/), a very good sci-fi game in itself, with an [online SRD here](http://www.vsca.ca/Diaspora/diaspora-srd.html). Consider everything not defined here to be the same as the Diaspora SRD, until this work goes beta.
