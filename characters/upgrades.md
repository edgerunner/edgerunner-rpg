# Upgrades

{% hint style="warning" %}
_Stunts and Augmentations from the previous version of Edgerunner have been rolled into one, and are called Upgrades now._
{% endhint %}

Enhancing your body and mind with technology is all the rage in the dark future. People go out of their way to shed their mortal limitations and embrace a smarter, faster, stronger version of their former self. Fortunately, there is enough technology in dark future to make this possible, practical and affordable. Unfortunately the only cost of transcending your meat body is not money, you also have to pay a price in lost humanity.

_An upgrade is a combination of an **aspect** and an **effect**, and optionally some **constraints**._

The _aspect_ part of the upgrade, which is also its description, is treated like a character aspect in the game, and subject to all kinds of rules that apply to character aspects; invokes, compels or being subject to modification during a refresh or after the character is taken out. As in other character aspects, try to make these unique, versatile and colorful, so that they contribute to the game.

{% hint style="info" %}
Let’s make a new upgrade for Cyra. These are a pair of designer bionic legs made to order, and they have been built to look good. Let’s call them `Incredibly hot bionic legs with glowing lace patterns`
{% endhint %}

The _effect_ is the way the upgrade provides a boost to the character. The strength of the boost provided also determines the level of humanity stress the character will be subject to.

{% hint style="info" %}
Continuing from the previous example, Cyra’s bionic legs are beautiful and quite distracting. They provide a _+2_ boost to her _Charm_ skill, bringing it up from 3 to a superb _5_.

This means that Cyra will also be mesmerized by her own beauty, slowly developing narcistic tendencies. She will be subject to an average of _2 shifts of humanity stress_ every time she uses her Charm.
{% endhint %}

_Constraints_ limit the scope of the upgrade to certain applications, as described below. They also reduce the humanity stess level.

{% hint style="info" %}
Let’s constrain the effectiveness of Cyra’s legs a bit. They are good looking and interesting, but only as a diversion. Let’s say the _+2_ boost they provide is only valid when using an _attack_ action directed at the target’s _cool_ stress track.

Now that there are two explicit constraints on this upgrade, its effective average humanity stress drops from 2 to _0_. Also, Cyra isn’t even subjected to any stress for any other situation that doesn’t fit the constraints.
{% endhint %}

Keep in mind that constraints only limit the boost provided. The aspect part of the upgrade can be used for anything without limits, just as a normal aspect.

{% hint style="info" %}
Cyra doesn’t get any boost for anything except the exact description of the upgrade effect for her legs, nor is she subject to humanity stress for those. But she may for example invoke her upgrade aspect with a fate point to give her Athletics roll a +2 or to reroll it. They _are_ bionic legs after all.
{% endhint %}

Upgrades come in many different guises. _Bionics_ is using implanted robotic and electronic devices to augment the body and the mind, while _Biotech_ refers to lab-grown, genetically engineered tissues and organs transplanted \(or ingrown\) to enhance physiological functions. _Nanotech_ involves using microscopic machines to either improve metabolical mechanisms at the cellular level, or just augmenting cells themselves. Also, _DNA manipulation_ can be used to change the inner workings of a human body at the very fundamental level. Also of note is the _special training_ a person may have, and maybe even _psychological conditioning_ that allows you to do better than you would normally allow yourself. And don’t forget _Pharmaceuticals_, which are just temporary ways of boosting your body and mind using chemicals. Even special _tools and equipment_ may be defined as upgrades. Also not to forget are the “social” upgrades a character may have, such as _positions of authority, power or influence_. And never limit yourself with the options presented here. Use your imagination.

Not everything that may be in one of the above categories is an upgrade though. An upgrade is something that provides a clear and consistent advantage to the character. Nanotech toothpaste is _not an upgrade_, so is an artificial hip joint, or being the shift overseer at the local bottling plant.

In Edgerunner, we _define upgrades based on what they do, not what they are_. Put effects before causes \(as everywhere else in the game\). Do not try to figure out how a bionic leg would affect your running. Instead, note how much of a boost for running you would like, and then describe what combination of devices lets you get that boost.

In an age where mass customization is the norm, no two upgrades look the same. The players should be able to define their own upgrades when creating their characters. There should be no hard limits on what’s possible, as the humanity risk imposes a soft limit on how much a player can cram into her character and survive the ordeal.

### Upgrade effects

Every upgrade provides a tangible, clearly defined effect that modifies an action the character may take during the game. Most of these effects have an associated numeric value, called the _boost_, usually a number that is added to a roll or another value. Every effect also has a base stress value used to determine how much humanity stress it causes when used. Below is a list of the core upgrade effects in Edgerunner.

**Boost a skill**

The simplest upgrade there is. Choose a skill to boost, and a number between +1 and +4 to boost it by. You can choose as high as you like, just remember that the more you boost, the more risk you take, because the base stress value is equal to the boost you choose.

| Aspect | Effect | Stress |
| :--- | :--- | ---: |
| Nanoscale blood thermal controllers | +2 to Survival | 2 |

You may boost one of the stress track skills with this effect. Just keep in mind that those skills are considered in use when the associated stress track takes a hit. The only exception is if you choose to boost your own Humanity, the upgrade causes Cool or Reputation stress instead when used, choose which when defining your upgrade.

| Aspect | Effect | Stress |
| :--- | :--- | ---: |
| Adrenal booster | +3 boxes to the Cool stress track | 3 |

**Boost a consequence**

You may boost an existing consequence slot by up to +4, increasing its capacity to absorb shifts. You may even create a new consequence slot. The base stress is equal to the boost. It is considered in use whenever the upgraded consequence slot is filled.

| Aspect | Effect | Stress |
| :--- | :--- | ---: |
| Crisis control protocol | +1 to the Moderate consequence slot | 1 |

If you use an upgraded stress slot for something that falls outside the constraints of the upgrade, it doesn’t come into effect. No boost, no stress, and the slot absorbs shifts at its original value, not the boosted value. A consequence slot created from scratch does not work at all outside its constraints.

**Accelerate consequence recovery**

The upgraded consequence slot recovers as if it is one step smaller. An upgraded severe consequence recovers after a refresh like a moderate consequence. An upgraded moderate consequence clears after single scene like a mild one. A mild consequence clears when the scene it was inflicted ends, just like stress. The base stress level is equal to the extra shifts the consequence provides.

| Aspect | Effect | Stress |
| :--- | :--- | ---: |
| Immunity enhancing nanobots | Severe consequence slot recovers after a refresh if used for absorbing cool stress | 3 |

**Replace a skill**

You may choose to use an existing skill in place of another that you don’t have. The base stress value is 0, and it can even go lower with constraints. You can choose to replace stress track skills with regular ones or vice versa.

| Aspect | Effect | Stress |
| :--- | :--- | ---: |
| Con artist | Use Deception in place of Resources  | 0 |

The upgrade is considered “in use” only when you use the replacing skill in place of the one being replaced. You can use the replacing skill for its original purpose without any stress or limitation.

**Extra action**

You get an extra action with the specified skill for every exchange in a conflict. You may choose not to use it at all, avoiding the complications entirely but if you do, remember that it has a very high base stress value of _4_. You may perform this extra action before or after your regular action but when it is your turn, you must perform both your actions consecutively. Once you take such an action, you may use the extra action to continue the original in the subsequent exchanges.

| Aspect | Effect | Stress |
| :--- | :--- | ---: |
| Hardwired tactical computer | Extra Tactics action every exchange | 4 |

This effect has no use outside a conflict. Just assume that its aspect implies some kind of “doing without thinking” attitude when you are telling stories involving this upgrade.

**Control another entity**

| Entity type |  Base stress |
| :--- | :--- |
|  Faction |  +4 |
|  Extra |  +2 |
|  Goon |  ±1 |
|  Mob |  Level |

You may have another entity under your control, one that would normally be played by the referee. Make yourself a sidekick, subordinate, ally, mentor, brother, gang, company etc. Your character takes humanity stress whenever the entity takes a scene action under your control, or when it is first brought into a conflict. The base stress threshold depends on the entity type as shown in the sidebar.

| Aspect | Effect | Stress |
| :--- | :--- | ---: |
| Proud field officer | Control 387th Airborne | 4 |

When creating this upgrade, consider the relationship your main character has with this entity, and include it in the aspect-description of the upgrade.

**Other effects**

You may want to define other kinds of upgrade effects for your game, and you are welcome to do so. Just make sure that your effect is consistent across different use cases, fair in its balance of risk versus benefit, and everyone at your table is on the same page about how it works.

#### Choosing constraints

Constraints limit the application of upgrade effects to clearly defined game mechanics, and they also reduce the stress level of the upgrade to more manageable levels. When playing the game, an upgrade has no effect at all if the action falls outside the scope defined by constraints. An unconstrained upgrade is possible, but it is either very weak or very dangerous.

_Every constraint placed on an upgrade reduces its stress level by one_

**Single action**

The upgrade is only effective for a single action type. Choose one scene action or conflict action. It is useless for other action types.

| Aspect | Effect | Stress |
| :--- | :--- | ---: |
| CAT-3 Threat detector | +2 to **defend** your Cool track using Tactics | 1 |

**Single opposing skill**

Choose an opposing skill, the upgrade is only effective when your opponent is using the said skill.

> `Voice stress analyzer`: +3 to Empathy _vs. Deception_ Stress 2

| Aspect | Effect | Stress |
| :--- | :--- | ---: |
| Voice stress analyzer | +3 to Empathy **vs. Deception** | 2 |

**Single stress track**

Choose one of the cool, humanity or reputation stress tracks. This upgrade is good only for actions that affect the said track.

| Aspect | Effect | Stress |
| :--- | :--- | ---: |
| Sarcastic blogger | Use Charm instead of Composition  **to affect the Reputation track** | -1 |

**Effective range**

Determine a range where this upgrade has its effect. It becomes unusable if the target is closer or farther.

| Aspect | Effect | Stress |
| :--- | :--- | ---: |
| Big black sniper rifle | +3 to _attack_ using Firearms at **range 3** | 1 |

**Limited targets**

The upgrade is usable only for actions targeting either the character himself, or another character. Choose which.

| Aspect | Effect | Stress |
| :--- | :--- | ---: |
| Distraction tactics | +2 to move **another character** with Performance | 1 |

**Stress level**

This upgrade is only active when the chosen stress track has the chosen stress level. Choose one of the stress tracks and one of _no stress_ or _overstressed_. No stress means that the upgrade is active only when the selected track has no marked boxes. Overstressed tracks have at least one marked box _above the current stress threshold_.

| Aspect | Effect | Stress |
| :--- | :--- | ---: |
| Adrenal gland stimulators | +3 Athletics when **cool is overstressed** | 2 |
| Seeing the heart of the nemesis | +2 Close Combat when there’s **no humanity stress** | 1 |

**External effect**

The upgrade helps another character’s actions. The player of that character must be willing to receive the effect. Your character still takes the resulting humanity stress.

| Aspect | Effect | Stress |
| :--- | :--- | ---: |
| Chatty co-pilot | +1 to Driving of **other characters** | 0 |

You may choose to boost the skill-equivalent characteristics of other types of entities. Faction competencies, tech capabilities, skill categories for goons and mooks are all fair game.

| Aspect | Effect | Stress |
| :--- | :--- | ---: |
| Strategic consultant | +1 to **Strategy of factions** | 0 |
| Neurowired hotshot dogfighter | +2 to **Anti-air capability of aircraft** that have it | 1 |

**Delayed effect**

The upgrade takes effect later than typical. For scene actions, this means that the action takes one step longer on the [time track](http://edgerunner.merttorun.com/fate/resolution#time%20track). For conflict actions, this means that the upgrade comes into effect only on a [continue action](http://edgerunner.merttorun.com/fate/conflicts#continue).

| Aspect | Effect | Stress |
| :--- | :--- | ---: |
| S-40 Homing Antitank Missile Launcher | **Delayed** +3 Firearms vs. Armor\(Capability\) | 1 |

If it is an opponent’s turn, then this upgrade comes into effect only if the opponent is continuing his action. For scene actions, it comes into effect only if no shifts are used to quicken the results.

### Humanity stress

Every time you or someone else makes a skill roll that is somehow affected by an upgrade on your character, he is subject to some Humanity stress. When you are rolling, _take the raw value on the dice and add the stress value of the upgrade_. That is the Humanity stress your character will have to absorb. Use any combination of invokes and consequences to reduce it, and mark the remaining shifts off your character’s Humanity stress track.

{% hint style="success" %}
Jade has a `Broadband neural link` that boosts her already high Research skill of 3 by another +2. She does her homework find out about the mysterious individual that just gave her the cryptic warning about her boss. Lydia \(Jade’s player\) rolls ++-· getting a _+1_ on the dice, adding up to a fantastic _+6_. Lydia describes how Jade uses the residual image on her visual cortex to run an image matching search on the net, finds out that the mysterious man appears under six different names on various social networks but after running a cross-check with the census database, the original is identified to be a Wilson Quinch, who happened to attend the same high school with Jade’s boss. A deeper search reveals that they had been close friends up until two years after their college graduation, after which they suddenly ceased to communicate apparently after a quarrel over an unknown financial issue.

Fantastic results indeed, but it comes at a price for Jade. The original dice roll of _+1_ is added to the neural link’s stress level of _2_ to give Jade _3 shifts of humanity stress_. Jade’s Humanity of 1 isn’t enough for absorbing all of this, so Lydia opts to give her a moderate consequence; `Curious of little secrets` to show that Jade has set her ethics aside for a while.
{% endhint %}

If your opponent is rolling the dice, **subtract** the raw value on the dice from the stress value of your upgrade. That means the better your opponent rolls, the less humanity stress you suffer.

{% hint style="success" %}
Gatto has `Kevlar aramid subdermal armor` that grants him an extra severe consequence slot versus Firearms. When Hargan shoots Gatto with Firearms 3 plus a whopping +4 on the dice, Jon considers his options. He’s out of fate points and Gatto’s already in pretty bad shape after a prolonged scuffle with the cyber-psycho called Hargan. Gatto should be glad that he invested in the subdermal armor and endured the painful procedure to get it installed. Jon opts to use the extra severe consequence this upgrade provides, and writes down `Kevlar stops bullets but not the pain` in it to describe Gatto’s shock after surviving an attack that would instantly kill anyone, with only some chest pain.

Now, with an extra severe consequence as its effect, Gatto’s subdermal armor upgrade has a base stress level of 4, with the single constraint \(vs. Firearms\) reducing that to 3.

Since this was an action against Gatto \(rolled by William, not Jon\), we subtract the dice total of 4 from the upgrade’s stress value of 3, getting a _-1_. Gatto takes no humanity stress.
