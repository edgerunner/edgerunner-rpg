# Changelog

As you know, this is a game in the alpha stage of its development, and this website is constantly changing as I add, revise and remove rules, explanations and examples.

Here you can find a list of major changes I have made to the game, as well as the ones I intend to make soon. I won’t list minor revisions that do not change the game.

### December 2012

[Declarations](../fate/creating-aspects.md#declarations) are no longer tied to character skills. They are player actions, independent of the character.

[Assessments](../fate/creating-aspects.md#assessments) no longer create new aspects. They only make existing aspects taggable.

In the [character skill list](../characters/skills.md) _Netrunning_ is no more. It is folded into a new skill called _Net-smarts_ that acts more like an online version of Streetwise.

_Stunts_ and _Augmentations_ have been rolled into a single system, and are called [Upgrades](../characters/upgrades.md) now.

Conflict actions have changed. There are no longer any opposed rolls in a conflict. All actions are now rolled unopposed, and the only way to oppose them are through the new [Resist](../fate/conflicts.md#resist) action that turns shifts into stress.

[Contests](../fate/resolution.md#contests) now involve a single roll by the initiator, not two rolls.

[Challenges](../fate/resolution.md#challenges) no longer have a “difficulty”. The base target is always zero, and the referee will only determine how much time a result of zero takes.

[Consequences](../fate/creating-aspects.md#consequences) now only clear after the designated game time. They can be modified, though.

### January 2013

There are now fewer character aspects. Hope you haven’t printed a huge bunch of the old character sheets, because the [new one](https://s3.amazonaws.com/merttorun.com/edgerunner/edgerunner-character.pdf) is already here, as well as a special [fold-up character sheet](https://s3.amazonaws.com/merttorun.com/edgerunner/edgerunner-folding-character.pdf) in the FATE tradition.

The new sheets also include room for the [ghost list](../characters/#the-ghost), Edgerunner’s rather unique answer to character advancement.

[World creation ](../the-world/#world-creation)is now a mini-game on its own regard, played by players but without characters.

### February 2013

[Medias](../characters/roles.md#media-credibility) finally get the power they deserve.

[Techies](../characters/roles.md#techie-jury-rig), [alternates](../characters/secondary.md#alternates) and [mooks](../characters/secondary.md#mooks) have revised rules now.

### To Do

Being taken out in a conflict will have effects based on shifts from the attack roll.

Referees will get a limited amount of FATE points to spend.

#### Fate Core Compatibility

Evil Hat Productions, the original authors of the FATE system have started a [Kickstarter campaign for Fate Core](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/evilhat/fate-core). I will try to make Edgerunner compatible with this new incarnation of Fate. Edgerunner will continue to have its unique rules but they will be renamed to use a common language with Fate Core.

#### Renaming concepts

I intend to rename some concepts in Edgerunner, in order to either increase language compatibility with Fate Core, or because I believe that the new name will better reflect the cyberpunk atmosphere of Edgerunner. Here’s a list of the old words and the new. You may still encounter either of them until the day I finish editing. Just remember that they mean the same thing.

| Old | New |
| :--- | :--- |
|  Augmentations |  Upgrades |
|  Stunts |  Upgrades |
|  Tag |  Free invoke |
|  Temporary consequence |  Mild consequence |
|  Progress |  Issues |

## Edgerunner Scrapbook

Here is some of the stuff I have been considering for inclusion in the game. Some of it may or may not make sense, read at your own risk.

### Faction Functions

aka. Faction roles

* Gang — Turf : Designated zone recovers deployed assets
* Corporation — Subsidiaries : Can deploy other factions
* Unit — Cohesion : Deployed assets cannot be interrupted
* Tribe — Kinship : Can target all deployed assets at once
* Syndicate — Connections : Free scene aspect
* Agency — Jurisdiction : Always invoke aspect for free
* Movement — Momentum : Can use excess shifts

### Motivation stress track \(Factions\)

The Motivation stress track represents the willingness of the faction members to keep pursuing the faction agenda. A faction taken out on the Motivation track may fall victim to internal squabbles, or just grind to a halt. Its people stop doing their best, or even desert or sell out the faction.

### Asset stress spillover

* Characters &gt; Motivation
* Tech &gt; Leverage
* Factions &gt; Prestige

### Positive consequences

You may want your character to have longer lasting aspects than what scene aspects can provide. If you want such a robust aspect but cannot wait until the next refresh to swap one of the character aspects, or you want something robust but not really almost permanent, then you can use one of the available consequence slots on your character to put this aspect in.

You may pick any available consequence slot, and narrate a scene about how your character gets the said aspect. Then write down the aspect in the slot of your choice.

This aspect is like any other consequence in most regards. It takes up the slot and persists for the same duration. The only difference is that you get a free invoke for it rather than an opponent.

If there is a techie involved in the process \(your own character or a helping hand\) then you can turn this aspect into an upgrade that persists for the same duration.
