# Difference

Edgerunner is a collaborative game. That is, everyone at the table shares the responsibility of running a rich, smooth and enjoyable game. If you come from an established traditional RPG background, you may be expecting one or more of the ideas below, but you should replace them with their new counterparts when playing Edgerunner
