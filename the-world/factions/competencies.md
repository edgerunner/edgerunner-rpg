# Competencies

Competencies are a faction's equivalent of skills. Like characters, factions roll their competencies when they want to accomplish something that matters. Having a competency assumes that the faction has the necessary means in the form of personnel, equipment, expertise, assets and contacts.

Naturally, there is a matter of scale. There are tiny local factions like neighborhood gangs and gigantic global factions like megacorporations. When factions of different scales confront each other, their Influence is used as a modifier to their competency rolls. The same holds true when a faction acts against a character or progress, but the faction's focus or disposition is used instead.

Factions have six competencies, arranged in a pyramid. One at level 3, two at level 2 and three at level 1. They are assumed to have all other competencies at level 0.

* _Black ops_ — Sabotage, assassination, and other things requiring a dirty hand.
